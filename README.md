# Frame Advance

This is a full-stack web app for my end project capstone. Frame Advance is an application built for
competitive people who want to review
footage of past games in order to improve.
Users can create a post with a YouTube
link, create timestamps, and leave notes
about the things they need to improve on. Users can find
other players' reviews to learn from more
advanced players. Users will then have a
database of notes with video reference to
succeed in their game of choice.
